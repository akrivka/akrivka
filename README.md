### 👋 I'm a software developer from Czechia currently studying Secure and Reliable Systems at ETH Zürich. 

I made some projects:

- 🤖 Real-life [WALL-E](https://github.com/akrivka/WALL-E)! Caltech Ditch Day 2024 project.
- 🧩 Some popular [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) extensions:
  - [roamsr](https://github.com/akrivka/roamsr) - spaced repetition
  - [pyroam](https://github.com/akrivka/pyroam) - Python notebooks
- 🔵 [Cohort scheduling solver and Airtable extension](https://github.com/bluedotimpact/cohort-scheduling-extension) and [Time availability application](https://github.com/bluedotimpact/bluedot) for [BlueDot Impact](https://bluedot.org/) programs
  - (these have been moved to their organization and my commits squashed when a new maintainer took over :( but these apps have served thousands of students by now)
- ⏳ Complex [timetracking application](https://github.com/akrivka/timetracking) for Paul Christiano
- 🕵️ [Codenames](https://github.com/akrivka/codenames) played on Caltech campus with a real-time web application
- 🎶 Blacker Hovse (Caltech dorm) [music server](https://github.com/akrivka/nearer-music-server) used daily
